# Computational_Geometry_Pointset_processing_CGAL
This is a modern C++ style code written in The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) for basic point set processing tasks

The Cpp file loads a point cloud stored in an xyz file. It estimates normals on the point clouds. Then a point is picked, does an orthognal k nearest neighbor search using a kd tree and colors the neighbors.
